Checkers

This is a basic checkers game.

You can activate the game by going to the board.py page and hitting run.

This project took me something like a week to do, because I ran into a lot of issues.
For example when it came to putting images on the button, I ran into a issue where the whole button would
resize and minimize and when I looked online I couldn't find anything, so I needed to figure it out on my own.
Besides that I re-drew the board like 3 times, each time making the code more clean and effective.

Overall this was a great project for me to do, it gave me a lot of experiance with calculation and how to really 
run a whole project on my own, and keeping everything in a neat and orginized way (yes, I need to imporve my code cleanes
but overall I think it was good)

anyway, enjoy!
